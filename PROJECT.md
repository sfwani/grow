# üåø Project Name: **Verdant Vault**  
*(A Post-Apocalyptic Survival Gardening & Barter App)*

## üß† Idea Overview

Build a fully responsive, animated web app using **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Supabase** as the backend. This app is themed around a **post-apocalyptic world** where users must **grow their own plants**, **craft survival medicine**, and **barter with others** to stay alive. There is no external API dependency ‚Äî **all plant and survival knowledge is stored and grown by the community itself**.

---

## üíæ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, App Router, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion (for animations)
- **Backend**: Supabase (database + auth)
- **AI**: Gemini API (for survival suggestions and usage of plants in inventory)

---

## üîß Setup Instructions for Cursor

1. Connect to **Supabase** using the terminal.
2. Automatically create the following tables:
    - `plants`
    - `inventory`
    - `medicines`
    - `barter`
    - `karma`
    - `users`
3. Seed the database with sample **plant data** (at least 12 entries) with the following fields:
    - `name`
    - `category` (e.g., food, medicinal, utility)
    - `growth_time` (e.g., "2 weeks")
    - `sunlight` (e.g., "Full sun", "Partial shade")
    - `water` (e.g., "Moderate daily", "Weekly")
    - `difficulty` (e.g., "Easy", "Hard")
    - `image_url`
    - `description`
    - `user_id` (nullable for global entries)
    - `created_at`
4. Also, generate **mock users and sample data** for each table (e.g., growth logs, barter offers, recipes).
